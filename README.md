# College Assignment 

## This website is a assignment that I made in college, during the first semester.
## The assignment has a theme of the Brazil midwest enviroment.
## My group is talking about the parks of the capital Goiânia, Goiás.


## In adition to the website, we had to make a application using the MIT app inventor with the same theme.
## The aplication is the APS.apk and is, basically, a event booker. We tried to add a notification sistem, but due the plataform limitations, we could only made it work on older versions of the Android sistem.
## The person who made the application was Rodrigo (github.com/Rodrigaumm).

## The website is hosted at firebase, it is only in Brazilian Portuguese.
